# Acquisition Metrics

## Bounce Rate

The percentage of visitors who leave your website after viewing just one page. A high bounce rate may indicate issues with the landing page (e.g., messaging) or targeting.

## Conversion Rate

The percentage of users who take a desired action, like signing up for a newsletter.

## Landing Page Conversion Rate

The success of each acquisition channel in driving traffic, sign-ups, or purchases.

## Traffic Source Distribution

The breakdown of incoming user traffic by different sources, such as organic search, referrals, or paid ads.

# Activation Metrics

## Time to Value (TTV)

The time it takes for a user to experience the core benefits of your product after starting to use it. A shorter TTV leads to higher user satisfaction, engagement, and retention. In a product-led growth, optimizing TTV is crucial to ensure users quickly understand the value your product delivers.

## Onboarding Completion Rate

The percentage of users who complete the onboarding process successfully.

## User Activation Rate

The percentage of users who successfully complete a certain milestone in your onboarding process.

## Trial-to-Paid Conversion Rate

The percentage of trial users who convert into paying customers.

## First-time User Conversion Rate

The percentage of first-time users who complete a desired action, such as creating an account or purchasing. This metric helps assess the effectiveness of the onboarding process.

# Engagement Metrics

## Daily Active Users (DAU)

The number of unique users who engage with the product daily.

## Monthly Active Users (MAU)

The number of unique users who engage with the product monthly.

## Stickiness

The ratio of daily active users (DAU) to monthly active users (MAU), which indicates how often users engage with the product.

Stickiness = DAU / MAU

## User Satisfaction

## Session Frequency

The average number of sessions per user within a specific time frame.

## Feature Usage

## Customer Effort Score (CES)

Measures the ease with which customers can interact with your product or service. It is often determined by asking users to rate the effort required to accomplish a task or resolve an issue on a scale from very low to very high effort.

A lower CES indicates a more user-friendly product, which can lead to higher user satisfaction and loyalty.

## Task Success Rate

The percentage of users who successfully complete a specific task or set of tasks within your product. This metric helps assess the usability and effectiveness of your product's features.

## User Feedback Score

A quantitative measure of user satisfaction gathered through surveys, ratings, or reviews.

There isn't a single standardized method or rating scale. This could be a numeric scale (e.g., 1 to 5 or 1 to 10), a star rating, or a qualitative scale (e.g., poor, average, excellent).

# Retention Metrics

## Churn Rate

## User Retention Rate
